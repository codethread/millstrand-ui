     On an observed delivery-gate, handoff or landing failure, add the label
     `auto-run-failure` to card {card} and record the failing run/step, command,
     evidence, retained resources and any held merge reservation in a card note.
     Stop and leave the card open for manual intervention. Do not clear gate/error,
     retry a failed gate, spawn a replacement, withdraw the merge turn or claim
     success. These instructions override shared land's repair/retry guidance.
     Await executor-owned gates; never manually assert a passing result.
     Normal queue waits and await timeouts are not failures; reissue bounded waits.
     Never stop a Weaver or unrelated processes. Labeling is best-effort if the
     CLI itself fails; report that failure in your final response.

  (format/prose
   "
     This card has explicit user authorisation for autonomous landing. You own
     implementation and review, not merge or worktree removal. Start or continue
     shared land run `land-auto-{card}` with card {card}, feature {card}, branch
     {branch}, and worktree {worktree}. Inspect `strand workflow show land` and
     `strand prime merge-queue`. Drive resolve-pr and the mandatory basic review,
     adjudicate its findings and record actual immutable-range review evidence.

     STOP at land's signoff checkpoint BEFORE choosing approved. Approval starts
     executor-owned merge AND worktree deletion without another worker checkpoint.
     Do not approve signoff, merge, remove the worktree or finish the card yourself.
     A shell cd does not change the persistent working directory of your session.

     Prepare an independent canonical-root grunt:

     1. Resolve the canonical root with `wktree root` from {worktree}; use its
        .millstrand workspace explicitly for every subsequent strand command.
        Read card {card} for auto-run/workflow-run-id and auto-run/run-id. Verify
        the latter is YOUR current Harnesses run; if not, stop for intervention.
        Read that delivery run's ready frontier to obtain this ordinary step ID.
     2. Record a handoff on the card BEFORE launch: card, exact PR/head, review
        disposition, land run ID, delivery run ID, this handoff step ID, original
        worker run ID, canonical root, branch/worktree and owned resource inventory
        (exact PIDs/session names/scratch paths, or explicitly none). Stop your
        owned servers/browser sessions first where practical. Never guess ownership.
     3. Build the grunt prompt from that handoff plus ALL the finisher instructions
        below, with actual IDs and paths substituted. Launch via `strand agent run
        grunt`, not a synchronous subagent, agent assign, or interactive launch.
        Pass --by-identity with YOUR supplied identity, --cwd with the canonical
        root, --target with THIS HANDOFF STEP ID (not card {card}, which your active
        run reserves), --request-id `auto-land-finisher/HANDOFF_STEP_ID`, and
        --prompt with the complete prompt as one argument. Do not change the request
        ID or payload to get past an uncertain response: inspect `agent show
        --request` with the same key before declaring handoff failure.
     4. Confirm the accepted run and record its ID on this step as
        auto-run/finisher-run-id using strand update, and in a card handoff note.
        Return immediately. Do not wait for the grunt, complete this delivery step,
        or perform further worktree operations. The grunt owns the remaining work.

     FINISHER INSTRUCTIONS (include verbatim in the grunt prompt):

     You are the independent landing finisher, running from the canonical root.
     Keep your session there; use git -C or explicit shell cwd for the feature
     worktree. Do not claim the feature, implement new scope or launch another
     finisher. You serve the supplied delivery handoff step, not a new workflow.

     First await the ORIGINAL WORKER RUN, never yourself:
     `strand --workspace WORKSPACE await --query agent-run-settled
     --param run-id=ORIGINAL_WORKER_RUN_ID --min-count 1 --timeout-secs 1800`.
     Reissue on timeout; a stopped/terminal status alone is not proof of settlement.
     Before signoff, inspect that exact run and require settled=true, completed
     substatus and exit-code=0. Verify the handoff step's auto-run/finisher-run-id
     names your run, the card has no auto-run-failure label, and the supplied land
     run is still at signoff for the supplied card/PR/branch/worktree. Any mismatch
     requires the failure policy below, not an invented retry or alternate run.

     Use the existing authorization: read workflow choices and approve signoff with
     the exact PR and squash message. Drive THAT land run through its FIFO turn,
     validation, merge, main update and cleanup. Await executor-owned gates; never
     assert their success manually. At tidy-resources, clean only the recorded
     owned resources, recording anything retained. Complete tidy-resources only
     after cleanup is verified; land's finish-card gate then closes the card.
     Do not finish the card early or advance it by a generic lane edit.

     Verify land is done and the card is closed with outcome done. Only then
     complete the supplied outer delivery handoff step with your identity and
     landing evidence, and return a concise final handover. If that last bookkeeping
     action fails AFTER the card is closed, label/note the failure but do not reopen
     already-landed work or repeat the merge. Failure before land finishes leaves
     the card open. Never delete resources outside the shared cleanup contract.
