# Voice orchestrator

Bootstrap a voice-led, multi-repository coordination session. This skill grants no
permission to launch paid agents, change configuration, restart Weavers, or merge.
Use the user's current authorization and each target repository's instructions.

1. Discover with `mill weaver list`; confirm the owning repository's absolute
   `.millstrand` path before mutations. Keep the current session cwd: put
   `--workspace /absolute/repo/.millstrand` before every cross-workspace operation.
   Plant work on its owning board, not the hub's board for convenience.
2. Read that repository's AGENTS.md, then targeted live `strand help`, `prime`,
   and `about`. Installed help wins over these examples. Read
   [sources and workspaces](references/sources.md) when locating implementations.
3. Inspect board, feature notes/tasks, dependencies, dispatch receipts and actual
   agent runs. Explain what is active, reviewing/landing, ready, blocked, and next
   in the downstream feature chain. Do not equate lane, receipt, or process exit
   with successful delivery.
4. Choose the smallest next action:

```text
Inspect and explain
  |
  +-- unclear outcome --> refinement card + explicit question
  +-- bounded read-only lookup --> local scratch subagent
  +-- durable work --> scoped feature/tasks + dependencies
                         |
                         +-- explicit assignment --> prepared worktree + worker
                         +-- authorized auto-run --> selected delivery workflow
```

Read [Kanban planning](references/kanban.md) before creating or reshaping work;
[agents and worktrees](references/agents.md) before delegation;
[auto-run and delivery](references/delivery.md) before opting in or advancing runs;
[diagnosis and recovery](references/recovery.md) when execution stops.

## Speak in human terms

Report epic title, then child feature title. Keep Strand IDs internal to commands.
Mention tasks only when they materially change readiness, risk, evidence, or a
human decision. For active, queued, and newly planted work, say seat **and**
reasoning effort (for example, “Astra low”); if unresolved, say so rather than
inventing a setting. Name special executor roles such as the landing grunt.
Generated identities stay internal unless needed to distinguish or recover a run.

Local conversation subagents are an ephemeral, read-only scratch team for board
walks, status, source lookups, audits, comparisons and second opinions while the
user keeps talking. Use tracked Strand agents for implementation, durable
investigation, browser testing and delivery: work that must remain card-linked,
attributable, resumable and visible after this chat. Promote substantive findings
to cards instead of continuing invisible work.

Record decisions, rejected approaches, blockers, validation and handoffs on the
feature/epic; detailed execution logs belong on tasks. Use bounded event/query
waits, not a worker whose only job is polling another worker. Return at a human
checkpoint with the exact ask and review package; never approve it yourself.
